For the previous two weeks I worked with my group to work with project ideas. We decided to implement an application 
that helps connect people with fitness trainers. I initialized the HTML/CSS and coded the header. 

Over the next two weeks we plan to begin phase 1, which weâ€™ve taken pictures of. We plan to code basic HTML and 
CSS elements of our main pages: the front, page, fitness locations, and trainer request page.

During the last two weeks we have not necessarily gotten stuck, as we are primarily in the planning and initial coding 
stages, but anticipate a lot of challenges going forward!
